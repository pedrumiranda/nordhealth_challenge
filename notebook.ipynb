    "The pipeline follows a layered architecture pattern:\n",
    "- **Layer A**: Raw Data (`a_raw_data/`)\n",
    "- **Layer B**: Staging (`b_staging/`)\n",
    "- **Layer C**: Features (`c_features/`)\n",
    "- **Layer D**: Presentation (`d_presentation/`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each layer has a specific responsibility and outputs data for the next layer to consume.\n",

    "  ```sql\n",
    "  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY client_id, event_type ORDER BY event_date ASC)\n",
